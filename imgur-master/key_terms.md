#### Accelerated Learning
 Accelerated Learning is a methodology that focuses on more effectively using the brain—appealing to both the left and right sides and appealing to the emotions—in order to unlock an individual's full learning potential. Some might think Accelerated Learning is the act of acquiring a lot of information in a short time period. But that's not it at all. It's a holistic learning method where people can acquire and retain information and skills—for the long-term—because they are in an enjoyable, relaxed and emotionally safe learning environment. Participants work individually, in pairs, and groups. They interact, discuss and collaborate. They apply new information immediately through activities—getting immediate feedback about what they've learned and finding out in real-time what they don't know and how they're growing.
