# MileStone 8 - Imgur

## Release 0: I <3 Images

[IMGUR](https://imgur.com/) is the internet's most loved image hosting website. It's simple, easy to use, provides with various features and above all it's free. Also another beauty of the app is that it works as well without logging in or signing up. We're going to build a similar app today for our MileStone. 

## Release 1: Features? Features!

Explore IMGUR. Observe what all are the features it provides. Think about what's the basic functionality of the site and how does it implement it. Make a list of all the things you observed. Here are some tips:

FrontEnd:

- What does the flow of the site look like? 
- How does the upload flow work? How do we achieve similar functionality?
- How does the view flow work? 
- Is the album view separete from the single image view? How? 
- How does the profile page look? What's the styling of the site like? 
- How will you build the front end? Specifically, what will be your layout, what view extends what etc. 

BackEnd:

- How do we manage upload of images? 
- How do we ensure that we only upload images and not other formats? 
- You will need to create routes on the fly to display to the user once they upload. How will you achieve this?
- How do you manage one vs multiple uploads? 
- Once a user signs in, what all should they be able to see and do? 
- Each image has views. How will we record and display them? 

## Release 2: Brrrrreak!
Break down the app into various versions from 0.1 to MVP. Make certain check points where the FE and the BE will merge. You should have some set goals for these check points which you need to check. 

Since this is the first time where you will have 2 different kinds of code coming together to test things, you need to pan this really well. Spend some time thinking about how will you break down the tasks and how will you bring it altogether. 

## Release 3: Feel 
A lot of the beauty of IMGUR lies in it's simple design and really fast turn around time. 

You should aim to be as beautiful and fast (if not more beautiful and faster than) as IMGUR. 

Take some time to rethink the design on both the front end and the back end. Also think of how can you speed-en the entire process of upload and re-directing to the view page for the user.
